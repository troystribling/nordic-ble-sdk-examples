@brief Battery model that gives the battery level based on supply voltage
@details The model is based on the CR2032 coin cell battery. The nominal
voltage is 3.0 Volts. The voltage will drop as the battery drains.

/** @brief Calculates the battery level in percent based on supply voltage

@details The calculation is based on a linearized version of the battery's discharge
curve. 3.0V returns 100% battery level while the limit for power failure is 2.1V and 
is considered to be the lower boundary.

@param mvolts The supply voltage in mV (3000-2100).
@return Battery level in percent.
