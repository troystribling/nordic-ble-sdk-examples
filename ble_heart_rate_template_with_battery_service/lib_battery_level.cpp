The discharge curve for 6x Duracell Alkaline DC AA. It is non-linear.
Source:http://www.powerstream.com/AA-tests.htm
In this model it is split into 3 linear sections:
- Section 1: 9.0V - 8.4V = 100% - 91% (9% drop on 600 mV)
- Section 2: 8.4V - 6.6V = 91% - 7% (84% drop on 1800 mV)
- Section 3: 6.6V - 6.0V = 7% - 0% (7% drop on 600 mV)

These numbers are by no means accurate. Temperature and
load in the actual application is not accounted for! Also,
linearization is an approximate.
